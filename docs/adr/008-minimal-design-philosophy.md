# ADR-008: Minimal & Focused Design Philosophy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The app could offer many features and customization options. However, our target users (budget-conscious families) are often busy and distracted. Too many options creates decision fatigue.

## Decision

We will follow a **minimal and focused** design philosophy:

- Do one thing well: turn meal planning into a 5-minute task
- Provide smart defaults, not endless options
- One primary action per screen
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Every feature must directly serve meal planning

## Consequences

**Easier:**
- Faster development (fewer features to build)
- Cleaner UI (less to display)
- Lower cognitive load for users
- Easier onboarding (less to learn)

**Harder:**
- May frustrate power users who want more control
- Some legitimate features excluded (calorie tracking, social sharing)
- Requires discipline to say "no" to feature requests
