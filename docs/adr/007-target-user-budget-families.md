# ADR-007: Target User - Budget-Conscious Families

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A food planning app could serve many audiences: fitness enthusiasts, cooking hobbyists, busy professionals, families, etc. Each has different needs and priorities. We need to focus on one primary persona to make coherent design decisions.

## Decision

We will design for **budget-conscious families** as the primary user persona.

Characteristics:
- Planning meals for 2-6 people
- Primary goals: save money, reduce food waste, simplify weekly planning
- Often planning while multitasking or in a hurry
- Need to handle different preferences within the household

## Consequences

**Easier:**
- Clear prioritization: cost visibility, waste reduction, simplicity
- Design decisions become obvious (e.g., default to 4 servings)
- Features like budget tracking and ingredient reuse make sense

**Harder:**
- May not appeal to other audiences (fitness tracking, gourmet cooking)
- Some features deprioritized (detailed nutrition, complex dietary needs)
